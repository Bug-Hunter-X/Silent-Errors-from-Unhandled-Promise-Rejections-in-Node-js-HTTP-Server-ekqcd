# Silent Errors from Unhandled Promise Rejections in Node.js

This repository demonstrates a common but subtle issue in Node.js applications: unhandled promise rejections.  The code simulates an HTTP server with an asynchronous operation that can fail. If the operation fails, the promise rejection is not caught, leading to a silent error.  Node.js will log a warning to the console, but the server continues running, potentially serving incorrect responses or failing to respond at all to certain requests.

## Problem

Unhandled promise rejections can be difficult to debug because they don't always cause the server to crash. They might only manifest as intermittent failures or unexpected behavior.  This makes it crucial to properly handle promise rejections to ensure reliable application operation and informative error reporting.

## Solution

The solution involves using `.catch()` to handle potential errors from the asynchronous operation and implement proper error handling for HTTP responses.
